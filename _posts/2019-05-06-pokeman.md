Hi everyone! As you may know, several features are being added to Luigi in the near future,
and believe me, those are still coming. However, I wanted to discuss some things that are
currently in development as you read this, and those are... server! helpers...

What are server helpers? Well, they're what I call ways to quickly access information about the server.
We could go as simple as a server info command, but you know me..

We're talking rules! partners! giveaways! This is what you expect in the future.
But anyway, that's enough of me talking. Stay tuned for more information on this,
and keep using Luigi! Please..
