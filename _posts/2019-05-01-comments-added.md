You may have noticed that down there on this page there's a little Disqus frame. That's right, I've now added Disqus
integration for comments! This means you can now share your opinions on posts, or even give us ideas for the bot.

*Psst, this is the first of many updates that'll render this blog engine extraordinary!*
