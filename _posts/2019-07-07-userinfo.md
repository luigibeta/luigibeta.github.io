Hi everyone! I hope you've been enjoying Luigi Beta. As I mentioned in a previous blog post,
we are indeed working on the pokemon command (and you can actually check constant progress my Twitter and the Discord server), but
in addition I also just added a feature that in my opinion should be in every quality Discord bot...

*AHEM*

The user info command! This, well, provides info on the user. In a clean looking layout, it provides information on everything from
the join date to a list of all the roles. This may seem boring at first, and, well, that's because it is. However, I have included
a special feature that you probably won't see in very many other Discord bots... the ability to set a user description! While this 
can be abused, the thing I hope that people use this for is giving others an idea of who you are. This is also global, so you don't have
to remake your description if you go to another server. 

You can set your user description by using `+profile [insert description here]`.

That's about it! Enjoy the new features.
