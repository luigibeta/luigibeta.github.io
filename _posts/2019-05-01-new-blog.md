I'm very happy to announce the opening of our very first blog! I know, I know.
It's very crude right now, but it's made out of our very own blog engine! Isn't that amazing? Yeah, we know it lacks
comments, etc, but hey, we're gonna implement those soon! A downside with this is that we're gonna have to restart
the whole project upon adding a post because of the way routes work, but hopefully we're fixing that very soon.
Also, – and this'll be an easy fix – the posts are now displayed in alphabetical order, whereas they should be
displayed in reverse chronological order.
That said, I'll leave you for this post. Enjoy!
