You saw the title. Luigi Beta is now *sort of* public! What do I mean by 
sort of? Well, more or less, I have changed the invite permissions so that at this point
anyone can invite the bot to servers! And... that's it! Kinda...

Are you done reading yet? No? If that's the case, as
long as you're here, I might as well give you a precaution....

This bot is STILL in a beta state, which means that features can and sometimes will not work as expected.

If, however, you feel a bug is too nasty for dudes like you, feel 
free to report it with the feedback command. And that's it! Go invite
Luigi and tell your friends to do the same.
