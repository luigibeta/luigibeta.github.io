Wow, it's been quite a while since we had a blog post. So many things have happened (oh, and SMM2 is out! :D).
But now it's time to inform you about some features that the bot is going to have in the
near future. So let's start off with a bang, and what will most likely be the highlight of the article...
The Pokedex command! If I remember correctly I posted a post on this topic a few months back, and I just wanna say
that it has been revamped QUITE a bit. For starters, we have some more info regarding said Pokemon...

Mega Evolutions...

And even those cool little Alolan forms!
With this revamp to the command, there's some bugs myself and perhaps Samplasion will need to squash, so for the moment
the command has
been restricted so that only the owners can use it. Apologies.

With that out of the way, I just wanna inform you that your support for the bot means a lot to me. I will continue to
jump over the hurdles bot development has, and in the process,
make a bot that everyone can enjoy. Thanks for reading, and have a great day.
<br><small>Psst. A customizable leveling and logging system is on the way. Stay tuned.</small>
