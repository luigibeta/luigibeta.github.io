Hello there! Long time no see. I wanted to make this blog post to make you guys know
I'm always working on fixing bugs and adding features to this website!
The first change, and the more noticeable one, is the completely overhauled [commands page](/commands).

That's because commands are now grouped into 7 categories, respectfully Bot Utility, Fun, Gaming, General, Moderation,
Music, and Server Configuration. Each category now gets its own table, commands and a little indicator representing the number
of commands in that category. Isn't that awesome?

The second, and less noticeable change is the badge next to the Commands link in the nav bar.

It used to show a wrong number of commands, but no more! It now shows an exact number of commands,
which's actually the same as if you counted the commands one by one. The last change was a change in the width of the
footer in the commands page. It now stretches to the full width of the screen.

I want to conclude this post saying thank you to everyone who uses Luigi. You're awesome!
