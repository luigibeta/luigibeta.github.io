It's been quite a while since we had a blog post. That being said, I might as well jump straight into the news.

Luigi Beta means a lot to me. Here's to many more years of Luigi!

Heh.. you thought the post was over didn't you? Here's the real news: starting later today, Luigi Beta will no longer have a music system. There are a number of reasons for this, but I'll list just a few of them:

*   It's buggy
*   It's slow
*   Did I mention it's buggy?

But yeah, I don't really have much else to say other than that. However, although music is leaving, logging and leveling are coming! Since I won't have to deal with this system anymore, it'll allow me to focus on cooler and more exciting features for the bot! Exciting, right?

For real though, your support means a lot to me. I really hope you understand my decision. If you have any questions, feel free to join the development Discord linked above. Peace.
